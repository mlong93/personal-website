description: My thoughts on diversity in higher education

I could hardly contain my excitement as I opened college acceptances last year. I couldn’t wait to meet my new classmates and escape the monotonous Arizona suburbs. I joined each college’s class of 2023 Facebook group and devoured each new introduction post. Everyone was so different than me and the people I knew my entire life — they were equestrian champions, lived in cities around the world, and pursued a variety of interests, be it sustainability, English literature, or biomedical engineering. The class of 2023 sounded exactly like what the admissions departments advertised on their websites and brochures: diverse, unique, and passionate.

At least on the surface.

<i> I discovered that most classmates I met came from the same middle- to upper-middle class background that I myself grew up in. </i>

When I arrived on campus in the fall and talked with other freshman, I began to have doubts about diversity initiatives. Sure, I met a lot more people from different racial backgrounds, gender identities, and geographic regions than I had ever known before, but I felt that one key form of diversity was lacking: socioeconomic diversity.

Admissions departments always highlight low-income, first-generation, minority students on their websites, brochures, and social media. Major news outlets spotlight them and their stories as well. Fed by this propaganda, I expected to meet people from a spectrum of backgrounds, be it racial or socioeconomic. Instead, I discovered that most classmates I met came from the same middle- to upper-middle class background that I myself grew up in.

I met some insanely rich kids who led lives I couldn’t even imagine, but in all honesty I think I met about two actually underprivileged kids during my first year at MIT. The vast majority — regardless of gender, religion, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity — were children of engineers, lawyers, financiers, doctors, teachers, etc.

I realize some may say I only associate with others similar to me. Studies have shown that people tend to be attracted to like-minded individuals, whether that be those with shared interests, past experiences, or common values. I acknowledge that my circles are not as diverse as I wished they were. I could definitely do a better job reaching out to classmates in different clubs and classes and living groups. As a result, like a true MIT student, I decided to turn to numbers to justify my observations.

<hr>

There is a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/what-college-admissions-scandal-reveals/586468/">growing misconception</a> that “the more elite the institution, the more likely it is to be racially and economically diverse”. This is simply false.

At MIT, the median family income of a student is $137,600 and 61 percent of students come from the top 20% of households in the US. A staggering 29 percent come from the top 5% of households. Only 6.2% of students come from the bottom 20% of American households.

These disappointing numbers pale in comparison to other highly selective universities across the US.
In partnership with <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/education/">The Equality of Opportunity Project</a>, <i>The New York Times</i> published <a href="nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html>">data on college mobility</a> in 2017 and specifically compared the outcomes of students at 12 selective institutions in the US: the Ivy League (8), MIT, Stanford, Duke, and UChicago. (For clarity, I am only referring to the data on these 12 schools.)

All but 4 of those schools have > 15% of students coming from the top 1% of American households (MIT is one of those 4). In fact, about <i>one out of every 5 students</i> at Brown, Dartmouth, Yale, UPenn, Duke, Princeton, and Stanford belongs to households in that tier. Moreover, five Ivy League schools (Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, UPenn, Brown) enroll more students from the top 1% than from the bottom 60%.

Each of the aforementioned schools devote a significant amount of effort and money to recruit a more diverse student body. Yet for all their efforts only 5% of their student body come from the bottom fifth of US households.

Out of the 12, MIT actually ranks first in students coming from the bottom fifth of US households, overall mobility index (defined as the probability of students moving up at least 2 income quintiles), and the probability of a poor student becoming a rich adult (67%). In other words MIT is the best elite institution in the US in terms of student income mobility (16%). The other 11 institutions underperform MIT by a wide margin in this measure, with Princeton boasting only a 8.7% student income mobility score.

What about financial aid? Don’t colleges address the wealth gap in their student body through need-blind admissions and generous financial aid packages?

Colleges trumpet financial aid statistics prominently on websites and brochures. In <a href="https://web.mit.edu/facts/tuition.html">2019</a>, 60% of MIT’s undergraduates received some form of financial aid, with the average package worth $47,593. Thirty-one percent of students attended MIT with tuition waived. All but two Ivy Leagues (Dartmouth, Cornell) promise to meet a student’s full financial need.

In reality though, focusing on financial aid is just another marketing strategy. This is not to say that financial aid has not helped thousands of low-income, first-generation students finish college and uplift themselves and their families. Many of my friends receive financial aid. Without the money, they probably would never be able to afford the opportunities that a school like MIT offers.

When it comes to financial aid though, most colleges are omitting some key points about the program. For example, selective institutions pride themselves on being need-blind, or willing to consider your application regardless of financial aid. However, as I showed above, these colleges still enroll lower-income students at a much smaller level than their richer peers. Why?

One reason is that being “elite” depends not only on performance but also on prestige. In other words, “elite” is synonymous with rich (even better if you’re famous). A <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bastedo/papers/BowmanBastedo.ResHE2009.pdf">2008 study</a> by researchers at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Michigan found that once colleges try to diversify their student body, both racially and economically, applications dropped in the following years. While these findings may erupt into a debate between correlation and causation, it’s still difficult to deny that <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/10/admissions-college-ivy-league-prestige-upenn-philadelphia">upper-class Americans</a> equate “elite” and “prestige” with “money”.

Another reason for the large disparity in socioeconomic enrollment at colleges in the US is the fact that many institutions, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/08/03/despite-strong-economy-worrying-financial-signs-for-higher-education/">public and private</a>, are operating on a deficit. This includes institutions that are selective and generally considered prestigious — think Washington University, Boston University, Northeastern, Brandeis, Case Western, Oberlin, Tufts, and more.

As a result, admissions officers face an important tradeoff when admitting students. In the war room known as the final admissions committee, this means prioritizing the mediocre-to-decent, full-pay applicant over the underrepresented, talented one.

An <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anonymousadmissions/college-admissions-scam-felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-ivy">anonymous article</a> by a former admissions counselor at a private, liberal arts college in the Northeast confirms this. The counselor related, “If a student could pay full tuition, he was immediately more desirable… [Full-pay kids] were more likely than not to be admitted”. John Boeckenstedt, Vice Provost at Oregon State and former admissions officer at DePaul, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/10/magazine/college-admissions-paul-tough.html">corroborates</a> that most colleges will select the affluent applicant with decent test scores, which are only buoyed by extra test prep classes, over the lower-performing applicant from an underprivileged area, even though the latter could probably outperform the former given the same educational resources. Boeckenstedt labels this situation as a bargain for most admissions officers: “[their] decent test scores won’t hurt your US News rankings…[and] they can pay full tuition”.

As I described above, income plays a significant role in educational outcomes. From news headlines and research studies, we know that race plays just as large a role in educational inequality as well. Most studies between income and race in college admissions have analyzed the two independently. Is there a relationship between race and income at selective institutions then? Yes — just not the one most would expect.

<strong> High-income students of all colors are edging out low-income, first-generation students. </strong>

Richard Kahlenberg, a leading writer on education and a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/integrating-low-income-students-at-americas-elite-colleges/">writes</a> that for elite schools, “Low-income and working-class students of all races are essentially shut out… schools are bringing together largely wealthy kids of all colors”.

Thus, policies favoring wealthier students disproportionately affect low-income Latinx applicants.

The Latinx population in America is extremely diverse. It includes a large number of nationalities and other Spanish-speaking groups in the US, including Mexican-Americans. As a result, when a high-income Latinx student, from the US or from abroad, applies to selective universities in the US, they are at a distinct advantage to their poor, first-generation Latinx counterparts. Since affirmative action policies only broadly state “Hispanic/Latino” on application documents and SAT tests, this effectively controls for race and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=hte6-eIWuBsC&pg=PA199&lpg=PA199&dq=%22wealthy+hispanics%22%2B%22college%22&source=bl&ots=fCrVVdffn5&sig=ACfU3U2PtEQon9lbgiUxpQc1gy9dvAzodw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjejceO1M3pAhUJgp4KHfUZDnQQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22wealthy%20hispanics%22%2B%22college%22&f=false">allows wealth</a> once again to permeate through in another manifestation of educational privilege.

Wealthier students are more likely to be able to afford private tutors and nicer houses in nicer neighborhoods, so this means wealthier Latinx students are more likely to gain admission and attend elite universities, much in line with Kahlenberg’s observations.

The same principle belies black enrollment at elite institutions.

A <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/510167">2007 study</a> by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University found that most black students enrolled at 28 selective universities across the US were neither low-income, first-generation, or inner-city. In fact, 55% had a father with a college degree, with 25% having a father with a graduate degree. Similarly, 57% had mothers with a college degree, with 26% having a mother with a graduate degree. These numbers are <a href="https://www.jbhe.com/news_views/56_race_sensitive_not_helping.html">triple</a> that of the national average for blacks.

Furthermore, more than a quarter of the students surveyed reported coming from families earning more than $100,000 a year. At a nationwide scale, the percent of black families with annual incomes above $100,000 a year is just 7%. Factors such as private school attendance percentage and median value of an income show similar trends.

Finally, for Asian-Americans, a more delicate situation between race and income exists. To understand the situation, we need to first acknowledge the role of affirmative action in Asian-American college admissions.

Frequently considered the main target of affirmative action policies in college admissions, Asian-Americans have <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/harvard-lawsuit-bias-against-asian-americans-dismissed/140342/">sued Harvard</a> and lobbied for <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/ballot/1996/prop209_11_1996.html">California Proposition 209</a>, key battlefields of the implementation of affirmative action. As an academically high-achieving Asian-American from a decently middle class family living in a majority-white neighborhood, I’m the poster child for Asian-American campaigns against affirmative action. However, I support affirmative action for various reasons, which would require another article to detail.

Instead, I want to focus on the effect of affirmative action on perpetuating the racial and wealth gap for Asian-Americans.

Much like their Latinx counterparts, Asian-Americans are a heterogeneous group. There are hundreds of ethnic groups, a wide range of economic circumstances, and varying levels of education for first-generation Asian immigrants. Together, this means that lower-income, first-generation Asian-Americans are being disadvantaged as a result of race-conscious affirmative action policies. This is especially disappointing given that Asian-American subgroups experience the <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/">largest income gaps</a> among all racial groups. Furthermore, while <a href="https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AAPIReport-comp.pdf#page=48">around half</a> of Asian-Americans hold a bachelor degree or higher, that number falls to 27% for Vietnamese-Americans and 17% for Hmong- and Cambodian-Americans.

Thus, policies favorable to wealthy applicants also unintentionally favor Asian-Americans who live in better neighborhoods, whose parents have a high educational attainment, and who are disproportionately East and South Asian.

Collectively from these examples, we can see that the low-income, first-generation students, which more inclusive policies were supposed to target, are not actually benefiting. Ironically, these policies may have actually hindered the prospects of these underprivileged students. As the saying goes, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

<hr>

I’m proud to be a student at the best-performing university in terms of income mobility, a crucial measure in bridging the widening socioeconomic inequality gap in the US. However, it’s an open secret that education in America is rigged in favor of the wealthy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_college_admissions_bribery_scandal">Operation Varsity Blues</a> exposed to the American public the dark side of the college admissions industry: preference for athletes, legacy applicants, and children of donors.

But while most criticism of the college admissions process is focused on the legacy and large donor applicants, I wanted to use this article to highlight another disappointing aspect of college admissions: the myth of the minority applicant.

<strong> Elite institutions at the US still favor the rich applicant over the poor — regardless of race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. </strong>

<a href="https://diversity.cofc.edu/journal-articles/social-mobility">Americans are largely raised to believe that colleges are an engine for social mobility</a>. Unfortunately many colleges are, to the contrary, reinforcing socioeconomic inequality.

Don’t get me wrong. Higher education in the US has come a long way since the 1960s, when colleges — especially elite institutions — still excluded women, Jewish students, and other minorities in favor of WASPs (white Anglo-Saxon Protestant males). I laud private schools in New England for mostly overcoming the stereotype of WASP dominance over the last half century. However, diversity initiatives are still lacking.

Colleges in the US, especially elite, selective institutions, divert attention away from the unfair admissions policies that favor the privileged upper-class by highlighting financial aid statistics and campaigns to increase racial and gender diversity at their schools. While this may paint a rosier picture of these institutions, the reality does not warrant such optimism: elite institutions in the US still favor the rich applicant over the poor — regardless of race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.

<i> Before any misinterpretations arise, I would like to clarify that I am not advocating for any policy or modifications to existing policies in this piece. I also am not cross-comparing any racial groups; I look at disparities within each group. Finally, I do not intend to discredit anyone based on their racial and/or socioeconomic circumstances. I am simply shedding some light on — in my opinion — a lesser-known topic in college admissions and higher education.</i>
