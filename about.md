I was born in the Midwest and grew up in the Sonoran desert. After 8 years in the desert, I adamantly believe that desert sunsets are the most beautiful sunsets in the world. I also love hiking (the picture here is of Angel's Landing in Zion National Park) and am quite appalled that people in the East can "hike" with no mountains. 

If you want to check out my blog, you can find it here. <a href="https://github.com/mlong93/personal-website">Here</a> is the repository for this website.

### Academic interests
As a kid, I loved classical and tactical history. Sometime during high school, I decided to be an engineer and now hope to contribute to the intersection of AI/robotics (thank you, <a href="https://twitter.com/liu_cixin?lang=en">Liu Cixin</a>). This past summer, I worked with <a href="https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/">Prof. Max Tegmark</a> on a news bias project and also built a smart news aggregator iOS app (link coming soon!). I will be learning about computational chemistry at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/jonathan-rothbergs-race-to-invent-the-ultimate-rapid-at-home-covid-19-test">Detect</a> during January 2021 and building internal tools at <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/technology/">Roblox</a> for summer 2021.

### Curiosities
Despite going to an engineering school, I still am very much fascinated by the humanities. I currently enjoy reading about the political economy, <a href="http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamics/">cliodynamics </a>, <a href="https://www.neruda.uchile.cl/obra/obraversosdelcapitan5.html"> Spanish poetry</a>, abstract expressionism, and <a href="https://cti.lib.virginia.edu/frame.htm">classical Chinese literature</a>. Do <a href="mailto:mflong00@gmail.com">email</a> me if you want to talk or have a book recommendation!

### Why I didn't make my own Jekyll theme
Honestly I'm not the best designer so I found a Jekyll theme that looked cool, revamped it, and deployed it. I just want to share my thoughts and some projects. If you're interested in my resume, please <a href="mailto:mflong00@gmail.com">email me</a>!
