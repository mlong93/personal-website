# Currently
* I'm studying abroad at ETH Zurich (EECS) for fall 2022 in the electrical engineering department.
* I'm training for my [first marathon](https://www.athensauthenticmarathon.gr) in Athens, Greece on Nov. 13. A friend spontaneously convinced me to sign up in early July. Before then, I've never competitively ran more than a 5k. I ran my first half-marathon a month ago in Uster, Switzerland in 2:05.
* I'm an arts editor for [The Tech](https://thetech.com). I try to [write](https://thetech.com/authors/mindy-long) timely articles on books and food.
* I'm an incoming spring intern at Augment, a pre-seed company I discovered as part of the [Neo Scholar](https://neo.com) network. Generally, I'm interested in early-stage, high-growth startups doing work in space infrastructure, fintech, and computer systems. Things that stand out to me: challenging problems, smart coworkers, engineers driving product decisions, talking directly to consumers, wearing multiple hatsüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚öíÔ∏è

# Previously
* I wrapped up an internship on Stripe's [Financial Connections](https://stripe.com/financial-connections) platform. I researched, designed, and implemented an ownership parser and address matching algorithm for fraud detection.
* I created and managed teams at [HackMIT](https://hackmit.org). I spearheaded the development and release of our [first mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hackmit/id1582182786) and maintained our in-house [project submission platform](https://spectacle.hackmit.org).
* I built a controllable, line-tracking [robot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pf0zssbjoezy4pc/6.115-final-project-motorized-cart.MOV?dl=0) with obstacle detection. 
* I was the first iOS engineer on [Improve the News](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/improve-the-news/id1554856339), a smart news aggregator. I built the app during summer 2020 while working with [Prof. Max Tegmark](https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/) on a new bias project. Check it out!

# Interests
* **Space**   
Space reminds me that there are worlds greater than mine and that of humanity. I first became enamored by it as a child after receiving nonfiction books from my parents on stars and planets. After reading [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem), I decided that humanity's future lies in the stars and I want to build it.
* **8051/as31**   
Assembly is cool. Having nanosecond control over your code and knowing exactly what's on the stack is so powerful.
* **Reading**   
I was a voracious reader much before I was a science nerd. I actually read everything: classics, history, memoirs, economic development, historical fiction, science fiction, and poetry. Check out [what I've read](https://www.goodreads.com/mflong) and some of my [favorites](#favorite-reads). 
* **History**   
If reading was my first love, history was my second. Growing up, I was a classical and tactical history geek. After I read *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, I became more fascinated with *why* and *how* things happened as opposed to *what* happened. I'm also interested in classical China, specifically the role of women throughout the dynasties and cross-cultural exchange prior to the Song.

## Curiosities
What good is science if we don't know how to use it to improve the human experience? I love the humanities, and though I am not an expert in many of these fields, I enjoy learning about abstract expressionism, classical Chinese literature, and film theory. 

## What I do for fun
I don't consume mass media. I'm not on TikTok, Youtube, Twitch, Discord, BeReal, etc. I don't have any streaming subscriptions, and the only TV I watch is sports -- specifically the NFL, NBA, NCAA, and tennis. The only news publication I subscribe to is [The Economist](https://www.economist.com).

I like to read, bake, hike, and plan trips. Occasionally I watch film. My favorite movie is [Burning](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7282468/), and I like short stories and films that make me question what I see on screen.

## Quotes
**[*Seven Pillars of Wisdom*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57936.Seven_Pillars_of_Wisdom), T.E. Lawrence**   
I loved you, so I drew these tides of   
Men into my hands   
And wrote my will across the    
Sky and stars.
<br/><br/> 
   
**[*Why Literature?*](https://newrepublic.com/article/78238/mario-vargas-llosa-literature), Mario Vargas Llosa**   
But literature has been, and will continue to be, as long as it exists, one of the common denominators of human experience through which human beings may recognize themselves and converse with each other, no matter how different their professions, their life plans, their geographical and cultural locations, their personal circumstances. It has enabled individuals, in all the particularities of their lives, to transcend history: as readers of Cervantes, Shakespeare, Dante, and Tolstoy, we understand each other across    space and time, and we feel ourselves to be members of the same species because, in the works that these writers created, we learn what we share as human beings, what remains common in all of us under the broad range of differences that separate us.

**[*Kafka on the Shore*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=ggDp0LyIhk&rank=1), Haruki Murakami**   
Memories warm you up from the inside but they also tear you apart.
