# Currently
* I'm starting my last semester at MIT. I'm planning on pursuing my M.Eng. in EECS with a concentration in computer systems in fall 2023.
* I'm an arts editor for [The Tech](https://thetech.com). I try to [write](https://thetech.com/authors/mindy-long) timely articles on books and food.
* I'm decarbonizing the freight industry at [Parallel Systems](https://moveparallel.com) in summer 2023. I'm interested in early-stage startups doing work in space infrastructure or computer systems. Things that stand out to me: challenging problems, smart coworkers, and potential impact.

# Previously
* I finished my [first marathon](https://www.athensauthenticmarathon.gr) in Athens, Greece in November. My time was 4:51:16. A friend spontaneously convinced me to sign up in early July. Before then, I've never competitively ran more than a 5k. Check out [this vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiXPgtuylnk) my friend made about our marathon!
* Together with a team of 9, I won [first overall](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/collegiate-teams-take-home-honors-in-20th-rasc-al-forum) at NASA RASC-AL's 2022 Design Competition. Here's [our paper](https://arc-aiaa-org.libproxy.mit.edu/doi/10.2514/6.2022-4315) we presented at ASCEND 2022 and are currently publishing. The theme we chose was "Mars Water-Based ISRU Architecture" and the goal was to design an architecture to supply 50 tons of propellant in 5 years. I'm interested in space infrastructure, and one of my dreams is to build a city in space.
* I built a controllable, line-tracking [robot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pf0zssbjoezy4pc/6.115-final-project-motorized-cart.MOV?dl=0) with obstacle detection. 
* I created and managed teams at [HackMIT](https://hackmit.org). I spearheaded the development and release of our [first mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hackmit/id1582182786) and maintained our in-house [project submission platform](https://spectacle.hackmit.org).
* I was the first iOS engineer on [Improve the News](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/improve-the-news/id1554856339), a smart news aggregator. I built the app during summer 2020 while working with [Prof. Max Tegmark](https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/) on a new bias project. Check it out!

# Interests
What good is science if we don't know how to use it to improve the human experience? I love the humanities, and though I am not an expert in many of these fields, I enjoy learning about abstract expressionism, classical Chinese literature, and film theory. 

* **Space**   
Space reminds me that there are worlds greater than mine and that of humanity. I first became enamored by it as a child after receiving nonfiction books from my parents on stars and planets. After reading [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem), I decided that humanity's future lies in the stars and I want to build it.
* **8051/as31**   
Assembly is cool. Having nanosecond control over your code and knowing exactly what's on the stack is so powerful.
* **Reading**   
I was a voracious reader much before I was a science nerd. I actually read everything: classics, history, memoirs, economic development, historical fiction, science fiction, and poetry. Check out [what I've read](https://www.goodreads.com/mflong) and some of my [favorites](#favorite-reads). 
* **History**   
If reading was my first love, history was my second. Growing up, I was a classical and tactical history geek. After I read *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, I became more fascinated with *why* and *how* things happened as opposed to *what* happened. Recently however, I've learned to [always question](/posts/whats-fact-and-whats-fiction) what happened as well. I'm also interested in classical China, specifically the role of women throughout the dynasties and cross-cultural exchange prior to the Song.  

<br/>

## For fun
I like to [read](#books), bake, hike, and plan trips (18 countries and counting). My favorite landscapes (and hikes) are alpine mountains with moraine lakes. The most beautiful places I've visited are Banff, Alberta, Canada and Gornergrat, Switzerland.    

Occasionally I watch film. My favorite movie is [Burning](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7282468/), and I like short stories and films that make me question what I see on screen (arthouse, post-modernism).

I don't consume mass media. I'm not on TikTok, Youtube, Twitch, Discord, BeReal, etc. I don't have any streaming subscriptions, and the only TV I watch is sports -- specifically the NFL, NBA, NCAA, and tennis. For news, I subscribe to The Economist and The Wall Street Journal.

# Favorites
## Books
I primarily read classics, sci-fi, history, and the political economy, in that order. Recently I've become fascinated on the economic and political development of China, the origins of language, and why nations fail.

## Quotes
In no particular order.

**["Quit Your Job"](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job), Wolf Tivy**
To make such bets you must be indifferent at some level to whether you end up a king or a monk, or even dead. The indeterminate hedge-trader with his logarithmic utility function assigns infinite negative utility to ruin. The man of action serenely regards ruin as the most likely possible outcome, mitigates it where he can, and leaps anyway. He rejects the comfortable half-existence of drifting with the indeterminate human tide and manifests his bold vision into the world. 

**[*Seven Pillars of Wisdom*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57936.Seven_Pillars_of_Wisdom), T.E. Lawrence**   
I loved you, so I drew these tides of   
Men into my hands   
And wrote my will across the    
Sky and stars.
<br/><br/> 
   
**[*Why Literature?*](https://newrepublic.com/article/78238/mario-vargas-llosa-literature), Mario Vargas Llosa**   
But literature has been, and will continue to be, as long as it exists, one of the common denominators of human experience through which human beings may recognize themselves and converse with each other, no matter how different their professions, their life plans, their geographical and cultural locations, their personal circumstances. It has enabled individuals, in all the particularities of their lives, to transcend history: as readers of Cervantes, Shakespeare, Dante, and Tolstoy, we understand each other across space and time, and we feel ourselves to be members of the same species because, in the works that these writers created, we learn what we share as human beings, what remains common in all of us under the broad range of differences that separate us. 
<br/><br/> 

**[*Kafka on the Shore*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=ggDp0LyIhk&rank=1), Haruki Murakami**   
Memories warm you up from the inside but they also tear you apart.
