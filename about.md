I was born in the Midwest and grew up in the Sonoran desert. After 8 years amidst mountains and cacti, I adamantly believe that deserts have the most stunning sunsets. I also love hiking (the picture above is of the Lake of Glass at Rocky Mountain National Park) and am quite appalled that there are no rocky mountains on the East Coast.

### Academic interests
As a kid, I loved classical and tactical history. Sometime during high school, I decided to be an engineer and now hope to build a city in space (thank you, [Liu Cixin](https://twitter.com/liu_cixin?lang=en)). During summer 2020, I worked with [Prof. Max Tegmark](https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/) on a news bias project and also built a smart news aggregator iOS app, [Improve the News](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/improve-the-news/id1554856339). I worked on a bioinformatics project at [Detect](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/jonathan-rothbergs-race-to-invent-the-ultimate-rapid-at-home-covid-19-test) during January 2021 and built internal health-tracking tools at [Roblox](https://corp.roblox.com/technology/) during summer 2021.

I will be working as a software engineer at [Five Rings Capital](https://fiverings.com) during January 2022.

[Check out](../courses) a list of the classes I've taken.

### Curiosities
Despite going to an engineering school, I still am very much fascinated by the humanities. I currently enjoy reading about the political economy, [cliodynamics](http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamics/), abstract expressionism, and classical Chinese literature. Do [email](mailto:mflong00@gmail.com) me if you want to talk or have a book recommendation!

### Why I didn't make my own Jekyll theme
Honestly I'm not the best designer so I found a Jekyll theme that looked cool, revamped it, and deployed it. I just want to share my thoughts and some projects. If you're interested in my resume, please [email me](mailto:mflong00@gmail.com)!
