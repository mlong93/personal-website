Great classes are supposed to challenge your previous knowledge, draw on past experiences, and provoke a hunger for truth, inside and outside of class. 11.005, MIT’s Introduction to International Development, did just that.
While I originally enrolled in the class because of a general interest in the topic (I had read Jeffrey Sachs’ The End of Poverty and William Easterly’s The Tyranny of Experts prior), this class was my first formal introduction to the field.

Each reading compelled me to question what I originally held true about the world from my surroundings. From humanitarian intervention to climate change policy to the rise and fall of nations, I learned that development policy is a network of vanishing staircases, like in Super Mario. One step leads to another and there’s no way back. The lives of billions of people today and billions of people in the future will depend on an obscure book, some signatures on a document, or perhaps just a dictator’s whims. No country has checked all the boxes for industrial policy, economic growth, and poverty elimination, which makes defining the perfect model for development all the much harder.

In addition to analyzing policy, I was also encouraged to leverage my position as an “intellectual” to critique policy today. In particular, Noam Chomsky’s “The Responsibility of Intellectuals” reinforced my commitment to actively hold leading figures in society, governmental or corporate, accountable for their actions and to promote public discourse on policy initiatives.

My instructor, Ayan Meer, stimulated students’ interest through readings and lectures. Each topic covered readings from a variety of different viewpoints, best exemplified by the climate policy unit. His passionate lectures on the history of international development, which included Smith, Marx, and Western imperialism, reignited my enthusiasm in the intersection of history and economics.

Sadly, today was the last class and marked the end of Ayan’s last semester of teaching the class. But while 11.005 has ended, my study of international development has only just begun.
