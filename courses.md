A lot of my course-picking philosophy is inspired by [a good friend](https://zhengdongwang.com/blue_book/). Before I started college, he warned me not to double major. At the time, I couldn't understand why, but later I realized he was right. Double majoring piles you with more required courses. More required courses means less time to take courses that interest you.

To me, college is a time for exploration. My goal is to grow as a person and a thinker at MIT. With that said, here's a list of courses I've taken:
